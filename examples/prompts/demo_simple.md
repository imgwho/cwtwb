Build a sales dashboard for me using `examples/templates/twb/superstore.twb`.

1. Create 2 KPIs, the measures are sales, profit, aggregate with sum, text type，Create 2 Bar charts: "Sales By Ship Mode", "Sales By Category".

2. Arrange them in a new dashboard (1200x800) called "Auto Layout Demo".

3. Layout: The whole is a vertical layout, with 1 horizontal, 1 horizontal, 1 vertical, the first horizontal is the title, there is a logo space-occupying area, the large header, the second horizontal is the KPI placement, and the third vertical is 2 bar charts

4. Save to `output/demo_auto_layout3.twb`.
