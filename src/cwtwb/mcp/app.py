"""FastMCP server singleton and mutable workbook state for the cwtwb MCP server.

This module creates the single FastMCP `server` instance that all tool and
resource modules register against via @server.tool() and @server.resource().

It also holds the single active TWBEditor instance (singleton state).
All tools that need to read or mutate the workbook call get_editor(), which
raises RuntimeError if no workbook has been opened yet.

State transitions:
  (none)  →  set_editor(editor)   [create_workbook / open_workbook]
          →  get_editor()         [any subsequent tool call]
          →  set_editor(editor)   [create_workbook / open_workbook again resets]

There is no "close workbook" operation — saving the file is the final step.
The state is process-local and resets when the MCP server process restarts.

Import order matters: app.py must be imported before tools_*.py and resources.py
so that `server` exists when the decorators run.  The entry point (typically
run via `mcp run` or `python -m cwtwb.mcp_server`) imports all tool modules, which
self-register, and then starts the server transport.

The `instructions` string is what AI agents read when they first connect —
it summarises the required call order and points agents to skill resources.

    "add_dashboard exists in the default MCP tool surface and should be used when "

    "analyze_twb, or migration tools as substitutes for saving. "
    "validate_workbook only validates the active workbook or an existing file and "
    "does not write output. analyze_twb requires an existing .twb/.twbx file path, "
    "so call save_workbook before analyze_twb when analyzing a newly generated workbook. "
    "Do not infer tool availability from list_capabilities; list_capabilities is a "

    "Use inspect_excel_connection when you need a read-only preview of Excel sheet parsing, inferred datatypes, "

    "When authoring a dashboard layout, first call list_worksheets and lock the exact worksheet names; "
    "reuse those exact names in layout nodes to avoid name drift. "
    "For layout JSON, use the canonical DSL: container nodes use type='container' with direction and children; "
    "do not use zones or absolute-position dashboard schemas. "
    "Generate layout files with generate_layout_json first for DSL validation, then pass the resulting file path to add_dashboard(layout=...). "
    "Prefer a small fixed layout template and fill worksheet names and sizes instead of free-form layout generation. "
    "Use validate_workbook after saving when the human asks for an explicit validation report. "
    "For deeper semantic validation (formulas, field references, data connectivity), use "
    "validate_workbook_api which calls the Tableau Cloud REST API (requires .env credentials). "
    "Prefer core primitives first, and use list_capabilities or describe_capability "
    "when you need to check whether a chart or feature is core, advanced, or recipe-only. "
    "For professional-quality output, optionally read the agent skills "
    "(cwtwb://skills/index) before starting each phase. "
    "After save_workbook, use upload_workbook to validate the generated .twb on "
    "Tableau Cloud (requires .env with TABLEAU_PAT credentials). Upload success "
    "confirms the workbook is structurally valid. Optionally use screenshot_workbook "
