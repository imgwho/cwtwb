"""FastMCP server singleton and mutable workbook state for the cwtwb MCP server.

This module creates the single FastMCP `server` instance that all tool and
resource modules register against via @server.tool() and @server.resource().

It also holds the single active TWBEditor instance (singleton state).
All tools that need to read or mutate the workbook call get_editor(), which
raises RuntimeError if no workbook has been opened yet.

State transitions:
  (none)  →  set_editor(editor)   [create_workbook / open_workbook]
          →  get_editor()         [any subsequent tool call]
          →  set_editor(editor)   [create_workbook / open_workbook again resets]

There is no "close workbook" operation — saving the file is the final step.
The state is process-local and resets when the MCP server process restarts.

Import order matters: app.py must be imported before tools_*.py and resources.py
so that `server` exists when the decorators run.  The entry point (typically
run via `mcp run` or `python -m cwtwb.mcp`) imports all tool modules, which
self-register, and then starts the server transport.

The `instructions` string is what AI agents read when they first connect —
it summarises the required call order and points agents to skill resources.
