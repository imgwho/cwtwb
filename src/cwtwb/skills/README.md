# cwtwb Skills

Skills are expert-level guidance files that help AI agents produce
professional Tableau workbooks. Prompts explain what to build. Skills explain
how to build it well, phase by phase.

## Workflow Phases

```text
Phase 1: calculation_builder   -> Define parameters, calculated fields, LOD logic
Phase 2: chart_builder         -> Choose chart types, configure encodings, filters
Phase 3: dashboard_designer    -> Layout, worksheet captions, interaction actions
Phase 4: formatting            -> Number formats, colors, sorting, tooltips
Phase 5: validation            -> Local XSD, REST API validation, upload, screenshot
```

## Recommended Resource Flow

```text
1. read_resource("cwtwb://skills/calculation_builder")
2. read_resource("cwtwb://skills/chart_builder")
3. read_resource("cwtwb://skills/dashboard_designer")
4. read_resource("cwtwb://skills/formatting")
5. read_resource("cwtwb://skills/validation")
6. create_workbook(...) or open_workbook(...)
7. list_fields(...)
8. add_worksheet(...)
9. configure_chart(...) / configure_dual_axis(...) / configure_chart_recipe(...)
10. add_dashboard(...)
11. save_workbook(...)
12. validate_workbook(...) and, when configured, validate_workbook_api(...) or upload_workbook(...)
```

## Design Philosophy

- Skills are phase-specific, not generic prompt stuffing.
- Load only the skill needed for the current phase.
- Keep the workflow direct, workbook-oriented, and self-validating.
